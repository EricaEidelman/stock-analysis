# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Steve's parents are looking to invest into green energy and he wishes to provide them with accurate information for a sound investment decision. The purpose of this project is to find annual volumes and returns for select stocks as well as refactor the initial VBA code to run more efficiently in case Steve wishes to look at a larger amount of data. To that end, Steve has compiled start and end prices and daily trading volumes for twelve different stocks over the course of 2017 and 2018.

## Results
### Stock Performance
According to the data, 2017 seemed to be a good year for investing in green energy as every stock except for TERP had a positive return. In fact, the top two returns were both around 200% and included the stock Steve's parents had selected (DQ). By 2018, however, only two stocks maintained their positive return - ENPH and RUN - and even so, ENPH's returns declined from just over 136% to just under 98%. RUN was the only stock with significantly improved performance, with returns increasing from 9.5% in 2017 to 85.2% in 2018. DQ's performance was actually the worst in 2018 with a -61.1% return which, given that it had the highest performance in 2017, also meant that it had the greatest decrease in returns percentage-wise.

In general, volumes were higher in 2018 although 2017 saw the two highest volumes for an individual stock for SPWR and FSLR, respectively. Incidentally, these two stocks saw a drop in volume and were among the lowest performing stocks in  2018, which may indicate that an adverse event precipitated a drop in value and selling off of the two stocks. While DQ saw an increase in volume from 2017 to 2018, its significantly reduced returns may also indicate an upcoming volume reduction.

### Script Execution Times
When comparing the original and the refactored code, the refactored code takes an average of about 0.175 seconds (about 0.15 for 2017 and 0.20 for 2018) compared to the original's 0.82, or about 4.68 times quicker.

## Summary
- What are the advantages of disadvantages of refactoring code?

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
